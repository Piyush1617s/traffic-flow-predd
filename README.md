# Traffic Flow Prediction — Multi-Model Benchmarking (Ongoing)

## Overview
This project focuses on traffic flow forecasting using multiple machine learning and deep learning models trained on real world traffic datasets. The objective is to analyze model performance across different architectures and identify the most effective approaches for time-series traffic prediction.

## Key Highlights
- Trained and evaluated 40+ machine learning and deep learning models
- Time-series forecasting using real traffic datasets
- Implemented preprocessing, normalization, and feature engineering techniques
- Compared model performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics
- Generated prediction vs actual visualization graphs for performance analysis
- Ongoing experimentation with advanced architectures and optimization methods

## Repository Structure
- `*.ipynb` – Jupyter notebooks containing model training, evaluation, and experiments
- `traffic.csv` – Sample dataset used for training/testing
- `traffic flow prediction.xlsx` – Model comparison results and experiment tracking

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Status
Project currently under active development. Additional models, evaluation metrics, and comparative analysis are being added continuously.

## Future Improvements
